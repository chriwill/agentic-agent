# InstaAgent

This project focuses on developing an advanced, AI-driven solution that integrates an agentic language model (LLM) with Instana APIs to 
automate and enhance application performance monitoring. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) capabilities and reinforcement 
learning, the agent is designed to interact autonomously with Instana's monitoring platform, enabling it to query metrics, analyze data, 
and generate actionable insights in real time. The solution aims to streamline IT operations by reducing manual intervention, improving 
decision-making, and providing proactive alerts for system health. Use cases include automated performance analysis, anomaly detection, and 
report generation, ultimately empowering DevOps teams with smarter monitoring tools.
